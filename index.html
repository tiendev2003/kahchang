                            In the early days of February 2024, after consulting with many international friends, we
                            realized that they chose Vietnam as a study abroad destination partly because of its wild
                            beauty
                            and majestic nature. This is completely understandable because Vietnam's location and
                            climate
                            are very suitable for experiencing, exploring and relaxing activities. "I feel surprised and
                            excited when admiring the beauty of the mountains on the seas of Vietnam. They help me see
                            how
                            wonderful nature really is" - is what a friend from Russia told us. I. Statistics from
                            Google's
                            destination search trend tracking tool - Google Destination Insights show that the number of
                            international searches for Vietnam tourism is growing by about 50 - 75%, the 4th highest
                            increase in the world.

                            felt we needed to take more specific actions. Help many friends know and choose Vietnam as
